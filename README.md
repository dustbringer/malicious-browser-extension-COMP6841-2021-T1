# SusTab (COMP6841-2021-T1)
Malicious Browser Extension and ExpressJS Backend - Something Awesome Project for COMP6841-2021-T1. Mpt

## Description
The extension will replace a new tab page with a page. I will migrate the displayed behaviour to suspending tabs if I have the time.
- Suspending tabs: saving website link into a basic page that will load the page when needed

## Running the backend
In the terminal, run `yarn` in the root folder to install packages. Then `cd` to `/backend` and run `yarn start`. The backend will now be running.

## Installation of the extension
Make sure the backend is running to get the most out of the extension.
- Open `chrome://extensions/` and toggle the 'Developer Mode' switch on.
- Click on Load Unpacked (top left) and open the folder that the extension is in



## Using the extension
When the extension is installed and enabled, clicking on the icon in Chrome will bring up a popup with check boxes. Check the ones that you want to enable, then reload the extension.

The stored data will be in `/backend/data` where the file name is keyed by the unique user id.
